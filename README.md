# Choosing-a-Control-method-and-Design-of-Mamdani-Fuzzy-Controller-for-Nonlinear-System-using-MATLAB
The tasks to be performed for this assignment are briefly summarized as follows:
1. Choose an appropriate control method for the nonlinear system derived in the first assignment.
2. Design the controller for the system.
3. Compare the results of the derived controller with the results obtained with the linear controller
derived in assignment 1. Particularly, analyze the controller performance in the operation point for
which the linear controller is designed as well as in regions of the state space not covered by the linear
controller.
